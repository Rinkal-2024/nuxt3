Her professional journey began as a talent agent for New York City’s top still-life and beauty photographers where she learned the ins-and-outs of advertising and commercial photography and was surrounded by beautiful images on a daily basis. While representing these top talent photographers, she masterfully integrated this knowledge and experience into her own business and refined her skills as a photographer.  \r\n\r\nAmy is keen on creating beautiful, joyous and heartfelt imagery that tells a story. Her style is focused on connecting with her subjects and capturing the emotion and personality of everyone she works with while using beautiful, flattering light, paying close attention to detail, and ensuring the images are clean.  She enjoys creating portraits of couples that have a visual impact because your eyes are drawn to their deep expressions and deliberate placement — similar to what you see in magazines.  She loves to travel and lives her life by Paolo Coelho’s words: \"It's the possibility of having a dream come true that makes life interesting!”\r\n\r\nHer work has been featured in Inside Weddings, The New York Times, Brides, Huffington Post, NY Weddings Magazine, The Knot, VH1, E!, HBO Latino, TLC, Essence, Ebony, Munaluchi Bride, PopSugar, Grace Ormonde, and Style Me Pretty amongst others.",

As Marlis started her search for the perfect couture wedding gown in magazines and on the internet, it seemed that there was more available elsewhere than in Orange County. John encouraged her to write a business plan and three months later they leased a 300-square foot boutique in Corona del Mar. John and Marlis were married eight months after The White Dress opened on October 4, 2003 at Bacara Resort and Spa in Santa Barbara.\r\n\r\nSince its inception in 2002, The White Dress has grown to become one of the pre-eminent Couture Bridal Salons in the country. While The White Dress has expanded well beyond its original footprint to include seven dressing rooms, a bridesmaids lounge and 3,000 square feet of showroom space, the experience remains personal, attentive and truly unique.\r\n\r\nThe moment you enter the salon you will be warmly greeted and paired with you own stylist who will make you and your companions comfortable. Your stylist will help you not only in finding your dream gown, but creating an entire look for your day. Our professional stylists will assist you in understanding fit, fabrications and the look that is best for your event.\r\n\r\nAnd prepare to hear corks popping! Every bride who finds 'the one' at The White Dress is toasted with Champagne. Be sure to note the glass vitrines throughout the shop filled with corks signed by White Dress Brides.",
